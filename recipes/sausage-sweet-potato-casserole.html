        <li>1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk regular pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®)</li>
        <li>1 cup baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>10 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine sweet potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper on a large baking sheet in a single, even layer; toss to coat well.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and red pepper; cook and stir until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and stir for 1 more minute. Transfer mixture to a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook and break apart with a spatula until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain sausage and add to the bowl with the veggie mixture. Add spinach, mozzarella cheese, and rosemary to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Gently whisk eggs, milk, and remaining kosher salt and black pepper together in a bowl until well combined. Pour over the sausage and veggie mixture and gently toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Place roasted potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour the veggie and sausage mixture evenly over top.</li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until eggs are set in the center, about 50 minutes. If the egg mixture starts to brown, put a loose sheet of aluminum foil over the baking dish to cover it.</li>
    </ol>
